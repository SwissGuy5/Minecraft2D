# Minecraft2D

A 2D version of the popular java game: Minecraft. Built as part of a graded assignment.

## Description

The game is a 2D open world game with realistic lighting and procedural terrain generation. The terrain is split into chunks, which are 2D arrays of blocks. The player can move around and interact with the world by placing or destroying blocks, which impacts the lighting and is saved for when the game is launched again in the same world (using the same seed). The most advanced features of the game are its procedural terrain generation and lighting system, whose development process is described in detail below.
